#The data will test the hypothesis of whether monarch butterflies of two populations evolve to live better when infected with a parasite.

#The host parasite evolution shows that infected individuals from Miami started to live shorter lives, which may require more research.
#Monarchs infected with the parasite in Miami did not show changes in longevity as more monarchs were infected. This may suggest the 
  #monarchs and parasites are co evolving.
#Monarchs not infected in Hawaii began to live longer lives.
#Monarchs that were infected with the parasite in Hawaii also started living longer lives. This may suggest something about the environment
  #in Hawaii is better suitable for the monarchs to better evolve or live with the parasite. 
#As whole populations that are not split into monarchs who are and are not affected, those in Hawaii have evolved to live longer while
  #those in Miami do not show a pattern of change in their overall longevity.
